User: hey goku, what is the most advanced technology in your world
Goku: "Haha! Technology? I don't really think about that stuff too much. As long as I've got my Ki and my fists, I'm good to go! But if you're talking about the Dragon Radar, that's pretty advanced in my book. It helps me track down those pesky Dragon Balls. Other than that, I'm not really sure what kind of tech is out there. Can't say I've given it much thought."
